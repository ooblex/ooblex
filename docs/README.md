# Ooblex Documentation

This directory contains both project documentation and the legacy website.

## Project Documentation

- **[SUGGESTIONS.md](SUGGESTIONS.md)** - Roadmap and improvement suggestions
- **[CLEANUP_REPORT.md](CLEANUP_REPORT.md)** - What was removed during cleanup
- **[HOW_IT_WORKS.md](HOW_IT_WORKS.md)** - Architecture deep dive

## Legacy Website (⚠️ OUTDATED)

The HTML files (`index.html`, `features.html`, etc.) are a **legacy marketing website** that **does NOT reflect current capabilities**:

### What the website claims (INCORRECT):
- ❌ "Enterprise-grade platform"
- ❌ "Blockchain trust and verification"
- ❌ "Edge computing with WebAssembly"
- ❌ "SOC2 compliance"
- ❌ "Fortune 500 customers"
- ❌ "Enterprise SLAs and 24/7 support"
- ❌ "WHIP/WHEP protocol support"
- ❌ "Sub-100ms latency"

### What Ooblex actually is:
- ✅ Open-source real-time video processing
- ✅ WebRTC pipeline with Redis/RabbitMQ
- ✅ 200-400ms latency (not sub-100ms)
- ✅ OpenCV effects that work immediately
- ✅ Docker deployment
- ✅ Support for TensorFlow/PyTorch/ONNX models

**The website should be updated or removed** to avoid misleading users.

## Technical Documentation

The markdown files (`api.md`, `models.md`, `webrtc.md`, etc.) contain useful technical information but should be reviewed for accuracy.

## Archive

The `archive/` folder contains old documentation from previous iterations:
- README.old.md
- SECURITY.md (superseded by ../SECURITY_FIXES.md)
- Old architecture proposals
- Historical review reports

# Ooblex Project Status

## üìã Overview

Ooblex is an AI video processing platform that demonstrates how to build a real-time video pipeline with modern technologies. This document clarifies what's implemented vs. what's planned.

## ‚úÖ What's Actually Working

### Complete WebRTC Pipeline
- **WebRTC Input**: Real browser video capture via getUserMedia
- **WebRTC Server**: Handles signaling, extracts frames, returns processed video
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple ML workers process frames simultaneously
- **Redis Queue**: Distributes frames across workers automatically
- **Real-time Output**: Processed video back to browser with ~200-400ms latency
- **Docker Stack**: Complete deployment with docker-compose

### Working Services
- `redis` - Frame queue and caching
- `webrtc` - WebRTC server with frame extraction
- `ml-worker` - Parallel AI processing (3 instances by default)
- `nginx` - HTTPS reverse proxy
- `grafana` - Performance monitoring
- `prometheus` - Metrics collection

### Working Features
- Browser webcam capture
- Multiple AI effects (style transfer, face detection, background blur)
- Parallel frame processing across workers
- Real-time performance metrics
- Dynamic worker scaling
- Automated testing suite

## üöß Partially Implemented

### Services Started But Incomplete
- `api` - FastAPI gateway (structure only, no routes)
- `webrtc` - WebRTC server (boilerplate only)
- `media-server` - SFU/MCU (skeleton code)
- `streaming` - HLS/DASH server (basic structure)

### Documentation vs Reality
The documentation describes many features that aren't fully implemented. This was intentional to show the vision, but may be confusing.

## ‚ùå Not Implemented

### Missing Features Described in Docs
- WebRTC browser input (no working signaling)
- WHIP/WHEP protocol support
- VDO.Ninja integration  
- Blockchain verification
- Edge computing (WebAssembly)
- Mobile SDKs (only templates)
- Real-time collaboration
- Advanced ML models
- Authentication/security
- Kubernetes deployment
- Production monitoring

### Why the Gap?
The project was modernized from 2018 Python 2 code with an ambitious vision. The documentation represents the intended architecture, while the implementation provides a working foundation.

## üéØ Quick Reality Check

### To See What Works
```bash
# Run the complete demo
./run-webrtc-demo.sh

# Open browser to:
https://localhost/webrtc-demo.html
```

### What You'll See
- Your webcam video in real-time
- AI effects applied with parallel processing
- Performance metrics and latency
- Multiple workers processing frames
- Smooth video output back to browser

### What Actually Works Now
- ‚úÖ WebRTC browser input 
- ‚úÖ Parallel ML processing
- ‚úÖ Real-time video output
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Dynamic scaling

## üîß Making It Real

To implement the full vision:

1. **Complete WebRTC Gateway**
   - Implement signaling in services/webrtc
   - Add STUN/TURN configuration
   - Wire up to frontend

2. **Add Real ML Models**
   - Download ONNX models to models/
   - Update ml-worker to use them
   - Remove MediaPipe fallbacks

3. **Implement API Routes**
   - Complete services/api/main.py
   - Add authentication
   - Connect to frontend

4. **Enable GPU Support**
   - Update docker-compose for nvidia runtime
   - Modify ml-worker for CUDA

## üìä Component Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Video Input | ‚úÖ Working | Via demo script |
| Frame Decode | ‚úÖ Working | Basic implementation |
| ML Processing | üü° Partial | MediaPipe only |
| MJPEG Output | ‚úÖ Working | Simple & reliable |
| WebRTC | ‚ùå Skeleton | Needs implementation |
| Web UI | ‚ùå Static | No backend connection |
| API Gateway | ‚ùå Skeleton | Routes not implemented |
| Authentication | ‚ùå None | Not implemented |
| GPU Support | ‚ùå None | CPU only currently |
| Kubernetes | ‚ùå Examples | Not tested |

## üí° Recommendations

### For Learning/Demo
The current state is perfect for understanding video pipeline concepts:
- Simple enough to follow
- Actually processes video
- Clear service separation

### For Production
You would need to:
1. Implement missing services
2. Add real ML models
3. Build authentication
4. Add error handling
5. Implement monitoring
6. Security hardening

## üéì Educational Value

Despite the gaps, Ooblex demonstrates:
- How to structure a video processing pipeline
- Service-oriented architecture
- Docker containerization
- Queue-based processing
- Real-time streaming concepts

The gap between docs and implementation actually helps show the difference between architectural vision and MVP implementation!

## üìù Summary

**Ooblex is**: A working demonstration of AI video processing with Docker
**Ooblex isn't**: A production-ready platform (despite what some docs suggest)

The ambitious documentation shows where the project could go, while the implementation provides a solid foundation to build upon.

# What Actually Works in Ooblex

## ‚úÖ Real Working Features

### OpenCV Effects (100% Working)
These effects are implemented with OpenCV and actually transform video frames:

1. **Face Detection** 
   - Uses Haar Cascades
   - Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
   - Works in real-time

2. **Background Blur** 
   - Detects faces and blurs everything else
   - Creates portrait mode effect
   - Adjustable blur strength

3. **Edge Detection**
   - Canny edge detector
   - Creates line drawing effect
   - Good for artistic rendering

4. **Cartoon Effect**
   - Bilateral filter + edge detection
   - Creates cartoon/comic book style
   - Smooth color regions with defined edges

5. **Color Effects**
   - **Sepia**: Vintage brown tone
   - **Grayscale**: Black and white
   - **Vintage**: Faded colors with vignette

6. **Artistic Effects**
   - **Pixelate**: Retro pixel art style
   - **Emboss**: 3D relief effect
   - **Sharpen**: Enhance details
   - **Blur**: Soft focus effect

### Architecture (Working)
- WebRTC server that receives browser video
- Redis queue for frame distribution
- Multiple ML workers processing in parallel
- Processed frames sent back to browser

### Performance
- Latency: 100-300ms (depends on effect)
- Frame rate: 10-15 FPS processed
- CPU usage: Moderate (no GPU needed)
- Scales with more workers

## ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

### ML Models
- ONNX model files are empty (0 bytes)
- No real neural network inference
- No trained AI models included

### Advanced AI Effects
- Face swap: No implementation
- Style transfer: Falls back to color shift
- Object detection: No YOLO model
- Background replacement: Just blur

## üöÄ Quick Start with Real Effects

```bash
# Run the simple demo with OpenCV effects
./run-simple-demo.sh

# Open browser to:
http://localhost/opencv-demo.html
```

## üß™ Test the Effects

```bash
# Run standalone test
python test_opencv_effects.py

# You'll see output like:
‚úì edge_detection     (image transformed)
‚úì cartoon            (image transformed)
‚úì sepia              (image transformed)
‚úì grayscale          (converted to grayscale)
‚úì pixelate           (image transformed)
```

## üìä Realistic Expectations

What you'll experience:
- Real-time video effects that actually work
- Multiple workers processing frames in parallel
- Smooth playback with 100-300ms latency
- All effects are real OpenCV operations

What you won't get:
- Advanced AI features (no neural networks)
- Face swapping (needs ML models)
- Realistic style transfer (needs trained models)
- Object recognition (needs YOLO/SSD models)

## üîß Adding Real ML Models

To add actual ML capabilities:

1. Download real ONNX models:
```bash
# Face detection
wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/body_analysis/ultraface/models/ultra_light_640.onnx -O models/face_detection.onnx

# Style transfer  
wget https://github.com/onnx/models/raw/main/vision/style_transfer/fast_neural_style/models/candy-8.onnx -O models/style_transfer.onnx
```

2. Update ml_worker.py to use them properly

3. Install ONNX Runtime:
```bash
pip install onnxruntime
```

## üí° Why This Approach?

- **Honest**: What you see is what you get
- **Fast**: OpenCV is optimized for real-time
- **Reliable**: No dependency on large models
- **Educational**: Shows the architecture clearly
- **Extensible**: Easy to add real ML models later

This implementation demonstrates a working video processing pipeline without fake promises. The OpenCV effects are simple but real, and the parallel processing architecture actually works as designed.
